## Description
![project demo](https://i.imgur.com/jVgA2gJ.gif)

 * Randomize - Generates the sentence.
 * Clear - Clears the GUI output field.


The generator works fairly simple, it combines pythons, random module
to and gets random words from txt files, and concatenates them to make a sentence.


## How i improved the project
in my opinion the provided list examples contained very little choice, so instead of list I gathered and parsed (with the help of Python) some text files, moist txt files contain around 500 words, some contain 50K plus words making it more random, in addition I made a simle GUI for the program.
