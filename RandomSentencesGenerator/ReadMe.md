# Random Sentence Generator
> This is an assignment project that generates a random sentence,
> from a number of list containing, names, verbs, nouns etc.

## Description



The generator works fairly simple, it combines pythons, random module
to and gets random words and concatenates them to make a sentence.

## How i improved the project
in my opinion the provided list examples contained very little choice, so instead of list I gather and parsed (with the help of Python) some text files, moist txt files contain 500 words, some contain 50K plus words making it more random, in addition i make a simle GUI for the program.
